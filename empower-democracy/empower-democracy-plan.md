# Empower Democracy — Massachusetts Elections

## Overview

A civic education platform for Massachusetts elections. Users explore candidates, see how they align with nonprofit reform organizations, rank candidates based on personal priorities, and donate to civic reform nonprofits — unlocking VoteCraft engagement content along the way.

The platform operates as civic education, not candidate endorsement. Donations flow to nonprofit organizations (not candidates), keeping VoteCraft in the 501(c)(3) lane.

## Page 1: Interactive Intro & Explainer

### Purpose
Set expectations before users dive in. Explain how money, alignment, and participation actually work in democracy.

### Key Messages
- Under capitalism, candidates need funding — often from wealthy donors or corporations — unless they commit to small public donations
- Perfect alignment with any candidate is unlikely; think ~50%, not 100%
- Civic engagement = votes **and** dollars — but "dollars" here means supporting the organizations fighting for reform, not just individual candidates
- Even small donations to reform orgs amplify your voice and influence the system
- Change happens through participation, even if the system isn't perfect

### Interactive "What-If" Mini-Game
A snappy, under-one-minute experience:

1. **Pick your issues** — Users select reform issues they care about (ranked choice voting, campaign finance reform, voter access, etc.)
2. **Get a token budget** — Users receive a small allocation of tokens
3. **See candidate alignment** — Candidates appear at varying alignment levels with the reform orgs championing those issues
4. **Allocate tokens** — Users distribute tokens across reform organizations
5. **See the impact** — Side-by-side: what happens when reform orgs are funded vs. unfunded, how that shifts the landscape candidates operate in

### Takeaways for the User
- Partial alignment is normal
- Supporting reform organizations shapes the environment all candidates operate in
- They leave feeling empowered, not overwhelmed

## Shared Features (Both Views)

### Personalized Candidate-Nonprofit Alignment Ranking

The core differentiating feature. Users see how candidates rank based on *their own priorities*.

**How it works:**

1. **Select organizations/issues** — User picks which reform orgs and issues matter to them (e.g., Rank the Vote, FairVote, campaign finance reform, voter access)
2. **Weight priorities** — User ranks or weights these via drag-to-rank or simple sliders ("RCV reform matters most to me, campaign finance second")
3. **See personalized alignment** — Each candidate gets a score based on the user's weighted priorities, calculated from public data:
   - Voting records on reform legislation
   - Public statements and positions
   - Questionnaire responses (sent to all candidates equally)
   - Published endorsements from 501(c)(4) orgs (displayed as fact, not recommendation)
4. **View ranked results** — "Based on what you care about, here's how candidates align" — framed as informational, not a recommendation

**Key principles:**
- The user drives the ranking — the platform surfaces data, not opinions
- Methodology is transparent and applied uniformly to all candidates
- All candidates are treated equally (no selective presentation)
- Framing: "here's how they align with *your* priorities" — never "vote for this person"

### Donation + Engagement Model

**Donations go to nonprofit reform organizations, not candidates.**

Partner organizations (examples):
- Rank the Vote (501(c)(3)) — ranked choice voting advocacy
- FairVote — electoral reform
- Other civic reform nonprofits aligned with VoteCraft's mission

**How donations work:**
- Users donate to partner nonprofits through VoteCraft (or via embedded partner donation forms)
- Donations are tax-deductible (for 501(c)(3) partners)
- Donating unlocks VoteCraft engagement content (civic-themed games or interactive tools)
- Under IRS quid pro quo rules, if the content's value is insubstantial (under ~$13.60/user), no special disclosure is needed
- For donations over $75 where content has measurable value, disclose the fair market value of the content received

**Candidate donation links exist separately:**
- Simple external links to each candidate's own donation page
- Not tied to VoteCraft engagement unlocks
- No money passes through VoteCraft for candidate donations

### VoteCraft Engagement Content
- Civic-themed games or interactive tools unlocked through nonprofit donations or candidate exploration
- Tied to supporting reform, not specific candidates
- Examples: Power Plays card game access, civic trivia, deeper "what-if" simulations
