# Empower Democracy — Massachusetts Elections

## Overview

Two landing page versions for Massachusetts elections, plus an introductory educational page. Users can explore candidates, rank them by personal priorities, donate, and unlock VoteCraft engagement content.

---

## Page 1: Interactive Intro & Explainer

### Purpose
Set expectations before users dive in. Explain how money, alignment, and participation actually work in democracy.

### Key Messages
- Under capitalism, candidates need funding — often from wealthy donors or corporations — unless they commit to small public donations
- Perfect alignment with any candidate is unlikely; think ~50%, not 100%
- Civic engagement = votes **and** dollars
- Even small donations amplify your voice and influence who can run and be heard
- Change happens through participation, even in an imperfect system

### Interactive "What-If" Mini-Game
A snappy, under-one-minute experience:

1. **Pick your issues** — Users select a few issues they care about
2. **Get a token budget** — Users receive a small allocation of tokens
3. **See candidate alignment** — Candidates appear at varying alignment levels
4. **Allocate tokens** — Users distribute tokens across candidates
5. **See the impact** — Side-by-side: what happens with financial support vs. without

### Takeaways for the User
- Partial alignment is normal
- Real-world impact scales with both votes and dollars
- They leave feeling empowered, not overwhelmed
