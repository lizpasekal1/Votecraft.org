# Power Plays — Rules (Current Version)

## Overview

Power Plays is a card game for 2–6 players inspired by Uno.

Players match cards by color or symbol to get rid of their hand. Along the way, they use power cards, lobby for influence, and occasionally vote to shift momentum.

**The goal is simple: be the first player to play all your cards.**

## Card Colors (Power Systems)

| Color | System | Theme |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Blue | Legislative | Voting, group effects, collective power |
| Yellow | Executive | Speed, skips, reversals, direct action |
| Red | Judicial | Blocking, reversing, canceling effects |
| Green | Federal Reserve | Trading hands, discards, indirect influence |

---

## Setup

1. Shuffle the main deck.
2. Deal 7 cards to each player.
3. Place the remaining cards face down as the **Draw Pile**.
4. Flip the top card to start the **Play Pile**.
5. Each player draws 1 black **Lobbying Card** and keeps it secret:
   - **Bill** (Legislative-focused)
   - **Court Case** (Judicial-focused)

---

## Lobbying Cards (Black Cards)

Each player has one hidden agenda for the round.

- **Bill Lobby Card** — Can be activated once when playing a Blue (Legislative) card.
- **Court Case Lobby Card** — Can be activated once when playing a Red (Judicial) card.

When revealed, the card gives a one-time bonus, then is discarded.

## On Your Turn

You must do one of the following:

### 1. Play a Card

You may play one card that matches:
- The **color**, OR
- The **symbol** of the top card

Action cards resolve immediately.

### 2. Draw

If you cannot play, draw one card.
- If playable, you may play it immediately.
- Otherwise, your turn ends.

---

## Action Cards (Examples)

| Card | Effect |
|------|--------|
| Skip | Next player loses their turn |
| Reverse | Change play direction |
| Draw 2 | Target player draws two cards |
| Swap Hands (Green) | Trade hands with another player |
| Block (Red) | Cancel the last action |

*(Exact card list can vary in prototype.)*

## Vote Card (Wild-Style Card)

When a **Vote Card** is played:

1. The card acts like a Wild card (player chooses the active color).
2. All players vote using cards from their hand:
   - Each player secretly selects one card of the chosen color
   - The highest number card wins the vote
   - Action cards count as 0
3. Reveal votes simultaneously.

### Vote Outcome

- The player with the highest number wins the vote.
- **If tied:**
  - Tie goes to the player with fewer cards.
  - If still tied, no one wins.

### Reward for Winning a Vote

- If the winning player has a **Bill Lobby Card**, they gain another Bill Lobby Card.
- If the winning player has a **Court Case Lobby Card**, they gain another Court Case Lobby Card.
- If they have already used their Lobby Card this round, the reward is saved for the next round.

*This represents successful lobbying.*

## Using Lobbying Cards

On a turn when you play:
- A **Blue card** → you may reveal a Bill Lobby Card
- A **Red card** → you may reveal a Court Case Lobby Card

When revealed:
- Apply the bonus written on the card
- Discard the Lobby Card after use

---

## Calling "Power"

When you have **one card left**, you must say **"Power!"**

If another player catches you before your next turn, draw two cards.

---

## Winning the Game

- The first player to play their final card wins the round.
- **Optional:** Play multiple rounds and reset Lobby Cards each round.

---

## Why This Still Feels Like Uno

- Same turn structure
- Same matching rules
- Same pacing
- Extra mechanics only appear occasionally
- No boards, no phases, no tracking

---

## What This Teaches (Without Explaining)

- Collective vs individual power
- Timing matters
- Influence can be built and spent
- Rules can be shaped, not just followed
- Quiet strategy beats loud moves
