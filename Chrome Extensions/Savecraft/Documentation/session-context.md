# SaveCraft — Session Context for AI

This file helps Claude (or any AI assistant) quickly regain context on the SaveCraft project without re-reading the full codebase.

## Latest Session Summary

- **`js/auth.js`** (new) — Firebase Auth REST API (email/password), no SDK. `getCurrentUser()`/`onAuthChange()`/`signUp()`/`signIn()`/`signOut()`/`getValidIdToken()`.
- **`js/storage.js`** — every `persist*` now dual-writes to Firestore (`savecraft_users/{uid}/...`) when signed in, via `_firestoreUpsert`/`_firestoreUpsertFields`. `runInitialSync(uid)` merges local ↔ cloud on first sign-in. New fields threaded through `loadAll()`/`_readLocalSettingsSnapshot()`/`runInitialSync()`: `lastfmUsername`, `followedCuratedLists` (a `Set`), `lastfmCache` (local-only).
- **`js/profile.js`** (new) — `renderProfilePage()`, dispatched from `render.js`'s `renderGrid()` on `state.view === 'profile'`. Reused by three entry points (Dashboard's Profile widget, Settings-dropdown `#btn-profile`, both in `dashboard.js`/`main.js`) — **all three currently skip the sign-in check** (demo mode; look for the "Demo mode" comments to restore `getCurrentUser() ? ... : openAuthModal()` gating later). Layout: Account card alone at top; Connections/Interests/Your Music Taste/Friends share a `.profile-widget-grid` sized identically to the Dashboard's `.dash-card`/2×2 grid (reusing that exact class), each scrolling internally if content overflows its cell.
- **`js/api.js`** — `ensureLastfmRecentTracks(username)` (public `user.getrecenttracks`, no OAuth) + `isLastfmConfigured()`; API key constant `LASTFM_API_KEY` is currently blank, same pattern as the pre-existing unused `YOUTUBE_API_KEY`.
- **Firestore**: `savecraft_users` collection/rules already documented in `firebase/votecraft-firebase.md` — this is a **deliberately separate** account system from the shared "Emporium" Votecraft account used by JokeMaster; a future "Connect to Votecraft" linking step is designed but not built.
- **Dashboard changes**: Favorites Spotlight and Curated Lists both rebuilt on a shared `.dash-thumb-card`/`.dash-carousel-*` component with seamless infinite-scroll (three duplicated copies of the card list, silently re-centered between clicks); `CURATED_LIST_DISPLAY_NAMES`/`CURATED_LIST_COVER_OVERRIDES` in `dashboard.js` cosmetically relabel some genres as curator/org-branded lists; Kanban mini-widget trimmed to Queue + In Progress only, cards enlarged; Dashboard no longer scrolls (`.grid-area:has(.dashboard-wrap) { overflow: hidden }` in `dashboard.css`); sidebar gained a persistent "Dashboard" link at the top (`render.js`).
- **Bug fix**: `detailModal.js`'s `ensureLiveItem()` was stranding a curated Music Album's artist name in `.notes` when the album got promoted to a real saved item (the `.notes` fallback only applied while `curated: true`). Fixed going forward, plus a one-time backfill in `storage.js`'s `loadAll()` for already-affected items.
- **New feature**: saving a Music Album now also triggers `autoSaveMusician()` + `autoImportMusicianAlbums()` (in `addEditModal.js`), mirroring the existing reverse (Musician → auto-import albums) behavior.

## File Locations

| What | Path |
|------|------|
| Chrome extension source | `/Users/lizpasekal/Documents/Votecraft.org/Chrome Extensions/Savecraft/` |
| Manifest | `…/Savecraft/manifest.json` (must stay at extension root — Chrome requirement) |
| Main library page | `…/Savecraft/src/app/index.html` |
| Library logic | `…/Savecraft/src/app/js/*.js` — 13 ES modules (`state.js`, `storage.js`, `utils.js`, `api.js`, `authors.js`, `render.js`, `kanban.js`, `detailModal.js`, `addEditModal.js`, `fetchAlbumsModal.js`, `dashboard.js`, `share.js`, `main.js`); see `savecraft-overview.md` for what lives where |
| Library styles | `…/Savecraft/src/app/css/*.css` — 9 files split by feature area |
| Background service worker | `…/Savecraft/src/background/background.js` |
| Content script | `…/Savecraft/src/content/content.js` |
| Popup | `…/Savecraft/src/popup/popup.{html,css,js}` |
| Sponsored page | `…/Savecraft/src/sponsored/sponsored.html` |

Always edit source code in `Votecraft.org/Chrome Extensions/Savecraft/`. Docs go in the same folder under `Documentation/`.

**Note:** The original monolithic `src/app/app.js`/`app.css` still exist as an unused backup (not loaded by `index.html` anymore) — safe to delete once the module split is confirmed working in a real Chrome load.

---

## Categories

```js
const CATEGORIES = ['Book', 'Game', 'Movie', 'Musician', 'Music Album', 'Show', 'Visual Art'];

const CAT_LABEL = {
  'Book': 'Books', 'Game': 'Games', 'Movie': 'Movies',
  'Musician': 'Musicians', 'Music Album': 'Music Albums',
  'Show': 'Shows', 'Visual Art': 'Visual Art',
};
```

- **Singular** values used in storage and the Add Item dropdown
- **CAT_LABEL** values used in the sidebar and grid title
- `Music Album` is **filtered out of the sidebar** category list — it appears only as a permanent hardcoded subfolder under `Musician` in the sidebar
- CSS class names use `catClass(cat)` helper: `'Music Album' → 'Music-Album'`, `'Visual Art' → 'Visual-Art'`

---

## Storage Layout (`chrome.storage.sync`)

| Key pattern | Contents |
|------------|----------|
| `item_<id>` | Personal item object |
| `author_<id>` | Author/artist profile object |
| `folder_<id>` | User-created folder |
| `savecraft_view` | Last active view string (restored on open) |
| `savecraft_kanban_sort` | Per-column sort prefs |
| `savecraft_kanban_lists` | Kanban column definitions |
| `savecraft_hidden_curated` | Array of dismissed curated IDs |
| `savecraft_curated_overrides` | User edits to curated items |

---

## State Object

```js
state = {
  items: [],          // personal items
  folders: [],        // user folders
  authors: [],        // author profiles
  view: string,       // current view (see View Routing below)
  search: string,
  sort: string,
  editingId: string | null,
  sidebarMode: 'categories' | 'curated' | 'sponsored' | 'home',
  modalCategory: string | null,  // currently-selected category in the Add-modal wizard (also drives Screen C's #modal-category select)
  // ...curated state, kanban state, etc.
}
```

---

## View Routing

`state.view` drives what `renderGrid()` shows:

| Value | Shows |
|-------|-------|
| `'dashboard'` | The Dashboard home page (`renderDashboard()`, in `js/dashboard.js`) — forced by `main.js`'s `init()` on every load, regardless of the restored/persisted view |
| `'All'` | All items |
| `'Music Album'` | Items with category === 'Music Album' |
| `'Musician'` | Items with category === 'Musician' |
| `'<folder-id>'` | Items in that folder |
| `'author:Musician:Gorillaz'` | Author page for Gorillaz (Musician category) |
| `'genre:Jazz'` | Curated genre landing — shows category list in sidebar |
| `'genre:Jazz:Movie'` | Curated genre + category drilldown — shows curated items |
| `'genre:Top 100:Musician'` | Curated Top 100 musician entries (100 artists) |
| `'genre:Top 100:Music Album'` | Curated Top 100 albums (2444 entries) |

Arriving at or returning to `'dashboard'` is deliberately never persisted via `persistViewState()` (checked at every call site that can set it) — so the real last-active view a user was browsing stays in `chrome.storage.sync` untouched until they navigate somewhere else for real.

`renderGrid()` early-returns to `renderAuthorPage()` when `state.view.startsWith('author:')`.

For `author:Musician:X` views, `getFilteredSortedItems()` returns:
1. User-saved `Musician` and `Music Album` items with `author === name`
2. Curated `Music Album` items from `CURATED_ITEMS` where `notes === name`

---

## Author / Artist Profile System

### Key functions
- `navigateToAuthor(name, category)` — sets `state.view = 'author:<category>:<name>'`, auto-creates stub profile if none exists
- `findAuthor(name, category)` — looks up by exact name + category match (case-sensitive by design)
- `persistAuthor(author)` — saves to `chrome.storage.sync` as `author_<id>`
- `renderAuthorPage()` — renders full author page into `#cards-grid`

All in `js/authors.js` (profile CRUD/navigation) and `js/render.js` (`renderAuthorPage`). Note: there used to be an "Edit Profile" modal (`openAuthorEditModal`/`handleSaveAuthor`) — it was dead code (never wired to a trigger) and was removed during the app.js → ES module split. Author photo/bio/website are now only ever set automatically via the Wikipedia/MusicBrainz enrichment lookups, not user-editable through the UI.

### Author page structure
- Back button in `#grid-title` → returns to category view
- Header: photo, name, bio, website
- For `Musician` category: **Fetch Albums** button appears on the header
- Works grid: all items by this author (includes curated Music Albums from CURATED_ITEMS where `notes === artistName`)
- Clicking an album card on the author page opens the detail popup

### Clickable names
- **Curated Musician cards**: the title itself is rendered as a `card-author-link card-title` button → clicking it calls `navigateToAuthor(item.title, 'Musician')`
- **Curated Music Album cards**: the `item.notes` (artist name) is shown as a `card-author-link` above the title → navigates to that musician's page
- **Detail modal**: musician title or album artist name is a `.detail-author-link` → closes modal and navigates to musician page
- Author name is immutable — it's the lookup key. Changing it would break the link to all items.

### Auto-save musician
`autoSaveMusician(artistName)` is called from `ensureLiveItem()` whenever a `Music Album` item is saved for the first time (e.g. when queued). It:
1. Checks if a `Musician` item with that title already exists in `state.items`
2. If not, creates one — pulling `url` and `imageUrl` from `CURATED_ITEMS[genre]['Musician']` if available
3. Persists it to `chrome.storage.sync`

The reverse direction: `autoImportMusicianAlbums(musicianItem)` (in `js/addEditModal.js`) runs whenever a brand-new `Musician` is saved via `handleSaveItem()` — fire-and-forget, not awaited before the modal closes. Calls `fetchAlbumsFromItunes(artistName)`, filters to `artist === artistName` (exact, case-insensitive) and excludes anything matching the singles/EPs title pattern or `type === 'Single'` (same filter `fetchAlbumsModal.js` uses), dedupes against any already-saved albums by title, then creates+persists the rest as `Music Album` items and re-renders.

---

## External Search Integrations

### Host permissions
`itunes.apple.com`, `openlibrary.org`, `store.steampowered.com`, `en.wikipedia.org` are all declared in `manifest.json` `host_permissions` — required for the respective `fetch()` calls to work from the extension page. Cover-art CDN hosts (`covers.openlibrary.org`, `cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com`, iTunes's `mzstatic.com`) do **not** need entries — they're only ever loaded via plain `<img src>`, not `fetch()`.

### Fetch Albums (author page)
`openFetchAlbumsModal(artistName)` — opens modal, calls `fetchAlbumsFromItunes()`, renders results.

`renderFetchAlbumsList(allAlbums, artistName, mode, hideSingles)`:
- `mode: 'exact'` — filters to `artist.toLowerCase() === artistName.toLowerCase()`
- `mode: 'any'` — shows all iTunes results
- `hideSingles: true` — filters out items matching `/ - (single|ep)$/i` in title OR `type === 'Single'`
- Singles/EPs default to **unchecked**; proper albums default to **checked**
- Already-saved albums are disabled

`handleImportAlbums()` — creates `Music Album` items from checked results.

### Add Modal Wizard (Screen B: category search)
Add is a 3-screen wizard in `js/addEditModal.js`: category grid → live search → review/refine. Each category dispatches to a different search function in `js/api.js`, all returning the same normalized shape (`{ title, author, imageUrl, imageUrlLarge, url, year, meta }`) so the results-dropdown renderer and the review-screen pre-fill don't special-case each source:

| Category | Function | Source |
|----------|----------|--------|
| Musician | `searchMusicians()` | iTunes `entity=musicArtist` |
| Music Album | `searchMusicAlbums()` | iTunes `entity=album` (generalized from the old author-field-only lookup) |
| Show | `searchShows()` | iTunes `entity=tvSeason`, deduped by `artistId` |
| Book | `searchBooks()` | Open Library `search.json` |
| Game | `searchGames()` | Steam `storesearch` |
| Movie | `searchMoviesWikipedia()` | Wikipedia `generator=search` — iTunes movie search is dead |

Search is debounced ~500ms on `#step1-search-input`. Selecting a result (or typing a title with no match and continuing manually) advances to the review screen (`showReviewScreen()`), which then kicks off background enrichment via the *existing* `ensureArtistWikipediaInfo`/`ensureItemWikipediaInfo` (Musician / Book·Show·Movie·Game respectively) to fill in Summary and upgrade the image — Music Album already has full data from iTunes, Visual Art has no source, neither triggers a lookup.

`handleSaveItem()` no longer requires a URL — Title is the required field instead (same red-border-flash validation UX, just checking a different field). This also fixed a latent bug: editing a curated item with a blank Title used to silently write `title: null` over the curated base item.

---

## Sidebar Structure

`renderSidebar()` iterates `CATEGORIES.filter(cat => cat !== 'Music Album')` — Music Album is never a top-level sidebar entry.

For the `Musician` category, a **permanent hardcoded subfolder** is injected:
```js
<div class="sidebar-item sidebar-subfolder ..." data-view="Music Album" data-permanent="true">
  [Music Albums icon] Music Albums
</div>
```

In **regular mode**: clicking it sets `state.view = 'Music Album'`.

In **curated genre mode**: clicking it sets `state.view = 'genre:<genre>:Music Album'` — the `data-permanent="true"` attribute triggers this branch in the subfolder click handler.

### Collapsible desktop rail
Desktop-only (the mobile drawer is a separate full-width overlay and unaffected). `#btn-sidebar-collapse` (in `.sidebar-header-controls`) toggles a `.sidebar-collapsed` class on both `#sidebar` and `#header-sidebar`, shrinking them to a 64px icon-only rail — CSS-only hiding via a `.sidebar-label-text` span that wraps just the text portion of each category/genre label (added specifically so it could be hidden without touching the icon or the click-handling/wiring, which is unchanged). Persisted via `chrome.storage.sync` (`savecraft_sidebar_collapsed`), applied in `main.js`'s `init()` the same way theme is (`applySidebarCollapsed()`/`toggleSidebarCollapsed()`, mirroring `applyTheme()`/`toggleTheme()`).

---

## Curated Data (Firestore)

### Firestore project
- Project: `votecraft-789`
- Collection: `curated_items`
- API key (read-only, safe to expose): in `_FIREBASE_API_KEY` constant in `js/storage.js`

### Loading
`_loadCuratedFromFirestore()` (in `js/storage.js`) paginates the collection in 300-doc pages.
Loaded at startup via `initCuratedItems()`, which calls `setCuratedItems()` (in `js/state.js`) to populate the module-level `CURATED_ITEMS` binding — this indirection exists because ES modules can't let other files directly reassign an imported `let`, only the exporting module can, so `state.js` exposes a setter for it. `init()` (in `js/main.js`) calls `initCuratedItems()` on startup.
Cached in `chrome.storage.local` for 24 hours. Cache version: `_CURATED_CACHE_VERSION` in `js/storage.js` (bump to force refresh).

### Category normalization
Firestore stores plural/legacy category names. `_CAT_NORMALIZE` maps them to internal singular names:
```js
const _CAT_NORMALIZE = {
  'Movies': 'Movie', 'Books': 'Book', 'Games': 'Game',
  'Shows': 'Show', 'Musicians': 'Musician',
  'Music': 'Music Album', 'Music Albums': 'Music Album',
};
```
Applied in `_loadCuratedFromFirestore()` before building `CURATED_ITEMS`.

### CURATED_ITEMS structure
```js
CURATED_ITEMS = {
  'Top 100': {
    'Musician':    [ { id, title, url, imageUrl, notes, genre, category }, ... ],  // 100 artists
    'Music Album': [ { id, title, url, imageUrl, notes, genre, category }, ... ],  // 2444 albums
  },
  'Classic': { 'Movie': [...], 'Show': [...], 'Music Album': [...], ... },
  'Jazz':    { 'Movie': [...], 'Music Album': [...], ... },
  // ... other genres
}
```

### Musician / Music Album data
- **Artist entries** (`id: artist_itunes_<artistId>`): `category: 'Musician'`, title = artist name, `notes: null`
- **Album entries** (`id: itunes_<collectionId>`): `category: 'Music Album'`, title = album title, `notes` = artist name
- All Top 100 entries have `genre: 'Top 100'`
- Singles/EPs filtered out by title pattern at import time

### Populating curated data (admin scripts)
Scripts live in the Claude session scratchpad. To re-run, the Firestore `curated_items` rule must temporarily be `allow write: if true`. After running, revert to `allow write: if request.auth != null` and bump `_CURATED_CACHE_VERSION`.

---

## Dashboard (`js/dashboard.js`)

The persistent home page. `renderDashboard()` is the sole export, dispatched from `renderGrid()` when `state.view === 'dashboard'`. Everything else in the module is private, split into per-widget `build*()` (returns an HTML string) / `wire*()` (attaches listeners after `innerHTML` is set) pairs — same idiom as the rest of this codebase's rendering.

- **Favorites aggregation** — `getAllFavoriteItems()` walks every `state.folders` entry named `'Favorites'` (one per category, created on-demand by `detailModal.js`) and collects their combined `folderId` membership from `state.items`. No prior helper did this across categories. `resolveFavoriteSlides()` falls back to `CURATED_ITEMS['Top 100']['Musician']` + `['Music Album']` (both defensively optional-chained) when the real list is empty.
- **Slideshow state** (`_favSlides`, `_favIndex`, `_favIsDemo`, `_favTimer`) is module-level, not part of `state` — ephemeral per-render UI state nothing else reads, matching how `kanban.js`/`render.js`/`detailModal.js` already keep private UI state module-local. The auto-advance `setInterval` self-clears on its own next tick if `.dash-fav-slideshow` is no longer in the DOM (i.e. the user navigated away), rather than relying on every navigation path remembering to call a cleanup function.
- **Kanban mini-board** reuses `KANBAN_COLUMNS` and `KANBAN_DEMO()` (both exported from `kanban.js` specifically for this reuse) so the widget's columns/labels/demo content stay in sync with the real board by construction, not by copy-pasted constants.
- **`.grid-header` gotcha**: `renderDashboard()` hides the `.grid-header` wrapper (sort/filter controls) entirely, not just its children — an earlier version only hid the children, leaving the wrapper's own `margin-bottom: 20px` unaccounted for in the "fill exactly this much height, no scroll" layout math, which caused a stray scrollbar. `renderGrid()`'s existing top-of-function reset block restores `.grid-header` to visible before any other view renders, so this doesn't leak into other views.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Curated vs. Personal Items
- Curated items are read-only in the UI. IDs: `cur-*` (original), `itunes_*` (albums), `artist_itunes_*` (musicians).
- `state.hiddenCurated` — Set of curated IDs the user has dismissed.
- `state.curatedOverrides` — User edits to curated items stored separately.
- `ensureLiveItem()` — clones a curated item into `state.items` the first time a user queues or bookmarks it.
- When a `Music Album` is first saved via `ensureLiveItem()`, `autoSaveMusician()` is also called.

### `chrome.storage.onChanged`
Handles `item_`, `folder_`, and `author_` key prefixes. Guards against double-adding items.

### Bookmark / Save Logic
- Bookmark outline = not in personal list. Filled = saved.
- Tapping **Add to Queue** auto-saves (calls `ensureLiveItem()` then sets `queueStatus`).

---

## Known Open Issues

### Header Alignment Bug (unresolved)
The left edge of **"+ Add Item"** and **"ALL QUEUES"** are visually misaligned. Multiple CSS attempts haven't fixed it. Needs live DOM inspection via DevTools.

---

## Planned But Not Yet Built

### Spotify Integration
Phase 2 of iTunes integration. Will add Spotify OAuth for richer artist data (artist photos, full discography). iTunes path is already established — Spotify would augment it.

### Kanban Search & Tutorial Banner
- Add search/sort filtering inside `renderKanbanBoard()` (currently ignores `state.search`)
- Add a first-time tutorial banner, permanently dismissed via `savecraft_tutorial_seen`

## CSS Design Tokens

```css
--primary         /* purple accent */
--surface         /* card/modal background */
--border          /* border color */
--text-primary    /* main text */
--text-secondary  /* secondary text */
--text-muted      /* muted/icon text */
--hover-bg        /* hover state background */
```

## How to Reload After Changes

1. Edit any file in `Chrome Extensions/Savecraft/`
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Click the **↺ refresh** icon on the SaveCraft card
4. Reopen the library tab (or hard-refresh it)

No build step — changes are live after reload. `src/app/js/main.js` is loaded as an ES module (`<script type="module">`), so `import`/`export` typos surface as console errors on the library tab, not silent failures — always check DevTools console after a reload when editing `js/` or `css/` files.
