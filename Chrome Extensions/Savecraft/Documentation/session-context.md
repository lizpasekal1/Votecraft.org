# SaveCraft — Session Context for AI

This file helps Claude (or any AI assistant) quickly regain context on the SaveCraft project without re-reading the full codebase.

## File Locations

| What | Path |
|------|------|
| Chrome extension source | `/Users/lizpasekal/Documents/Votecraft.org/Chrome Extensions/Savecraft/` |
| Manifest | `…/Savecraft/manifest.json` (must stay at extension root — Chrome requirement) |
| Main library page | `…/Savecraft/src/app/index.html` |
| Library logic | `…/Savecraft/src/app/js/*.js` — 12 ES modules (`state.js`, `storage.js`, `utils.js`, `api.js`, `authors.js`, `render.js`, `kanban.js`, `detailModal.js`, `addEditModal.js`, `fetchAlbumsModal.js`, `share.js`, `main.js`); see `savecraft-overview.md` for what lives where |
| Library styles | `…/Savecraft/src/app/css/*.css` — 8 files split by feature area |
| Background service worker | `…/Savecraft/src/background/background.js` |
| Content script | `…/Savecraft/src/content/content.js` |
| Popup | `…/Savecraft/src/popup/popup.{html,css,js}` |
| Sponsored page | `…/Savecraft/src/sponsored/sponsored.html` |
| Logo assets | `…/Savecraft/images/logos/` |
| Documentation | `/Users/lizpasekal/Documents/Votecraft.org/Chrome Extensions/Savecraft/Documentation/` |

Always edit source code in `Votecraft.org/Chrome Extensions/Savecraft/`. Docs go in the same folder under `Documentation/`.

**Note:** The original monolithic `src/app/app.js`/`app.css` still exist as an unused backup (not loaded by `index.html` anymore) — safe to delete once the module split is confirmed working in a real Chrome load.

## Categories

```js
const CATEGORIES = ['Book', 'Game', 'Movie', 'Musician', 'Music Album', 'Show', 'Visual Art'];

const CAT_LABEL = {
  'Book': 'Books', 'Game': 'Games', 'Movie': 'Movies',
  'Musician': 'Musicians', 'Music Album': 'Music Albums',
  'Show': 'Shows', 'Visual Art': 'Visual Art',
};
```

- **Singular** values used in storage and the Add Item dropdown
- **CAT_LABEL** values used in the sidebar and grid title
- `Music Album` is **filtered out of the sidebar** category list — it appears only as a permanent hardcoded subfolder under `Musician` in the sidebar
- CSS class names use `catClass(cat)` helper: `'Music Album' → 'Music-Album'`, `'Visual Art' → 'Visual-Art'`

---

## Storage Layout (`chrome.storage.sync`)

| Key pattern | Contents |
|------------|----------|
| `item_<id>` | Personal item object |
| `author_<id>` | Author/artist profile object |
| `folder_<id>` | User-created folder |
| `savecraft_view` | Last active view string (restored on open) |
| `savecraft_kanban_sort` | Per-column sort prefs |
| `savecraft_kanban_lists` | Kanban column definitions |
| `savecraft_hidden_curated` | Array of dismissed curated IDs |
| `savecraft_curated_overrides` | User edits to curated items |

---

## State Object

```js
state = {
  items: [],          // personal items
  folders: [],        // user folders
  authors: [],        // author profiles
  view: string,       // current view (see View Routing below)
  search: string,
  sort: string,
  editingId: string | null,
  sidebarMode: 'categories' | 'curated' | 'sponsored',
  // ...curated state, kanban state, etc.
}
```

---

## View Routing

`state.view` drives what `renderGrid()` shows:

| Value | Shows |
|-------|-------|
| `'All'` | All items |
| `'Music Album'` | Items with category === 'Music Album' |
| `'Musician'` | Items with category === 'Musician' |
| `'<folder-id>'` | Items in that folder |
| `'author:Musician:Gorillaz'` | Author page for Gorillaz (Musician category) |
| `'genre:Jazz'` | Curated genre landing — shows category list in sidebar |
| `'genre:Jazz:Movie'` | Curated genre + category drilldown — shows curated items |
| `'genre:Top 100:Musician'` | Curated Top 100 musician entries (100 artists) |
| `'genre:Top 100:Music Album'` | Curated Top 100 albums (2444 entries) |

`renderGrid()` early-returns to `renderAuthorPage()` when `state.view.startsWith('author:')`.

For `author:Musician:X` views, `getFilteredSortedItems()` returns:
1. User-saved `Musician` and `Music Album` items with `author === name`
2. Curated `Music Album` items from `CURATED_ITEMS` where `notes === name`

---

## Author / Artist Profile System

### Key functions
- `navigateToAuthor(name, category)` — sets `state.view = 'author:<category>:<name>'`, auto-creates stub profile if none exists
- `findAuthor(name, category)` — looks up by exact name + category match (case-sensitive by design)
- `persistAuthor(author)` — saves to `chrome.storage.sync` as `author_<id>`
- `renderAuthorPage()` — renders full author page into `#cards-grid`

All in `js/authors.js` (profile CRUD/navigation) and `js/render.js` (`renderAuthorPage`). Note: there used to be an "Edit Profile" modal (`openAuthorEditModal`/`handleSaveAuthor`) — it was dead code (never wired to a trigger) and was removed during the app.js → ES module split. Author photo/bio/website are now only ever set automatically via the Wikipedia/MusicBrainz enrichment lookups, not user-editable through the UI.

### Author page structure
- Back button in `#grid-title` → returns to category view
- Header: photo, name, bio, website
- For `Musician` category: **Fetch Albums** button appears on the header
- Works grid: all items by this author (includes curated Music Albums from CURATED_ITEMS where `notes === artistName`)
- Clicking an album card on the author page opens the detail popup

### Clickable names
- **Curated Musician cards**: the title itself is rendered as a `card-author-link card-title` button → clicking it calls `navigateToAuthor(item.title, 'Musician')`
- **Curated Music Album cards**: the `item.notes` (artist name) is shown as a `card-author-link` above the title → navigates to that musician's page
- **Detail modal**: musician title or album artist name is a `.detail-author-link` → closes modal and navigates to musician page
- Author name is immutable — it's the lookup key. Changing it would break the link to all items.

### Auto-save musician
`autoSaveMusician(artistName)` is called from `ensureLiveItem()` whenever a `Music Album` item is saved for the first time (e.g. when queued). It:
1. Checks if a `Musician` item with that title already exists in `state.items`
2. If not, creates one — pulling `url` and `imageUrl` from `CURATED_ITEMS[genre]['Musician']` if available
3. Persists it to `chrome.storage.sync`

---

## iTunes Integration

### Host permission
`itunes.apple.com` is declared in `manifest.json` `host_permissions`. Required for all iTunes fetch calls.

### Fetch Albums (author page)
`openFetchAlbumsModal(artistName)` — opens modal, calls `fetchAlbumsFromItunes()`, renders results.

`renderFetchAlbumsList(allAlbums, artistName, mode, hideSingles)`:
- `mode: 'exact'` — filters to `artist.toLowerCase() === artistName.toLowerCase()`
- `mode: 'any'` — shows all iTunes results
- `hideSingles: true` — filters out items matching `/ - (single|ep)$/i` in title OR `type === 'Single'`
- Singles/EPs default to **unchecked**; proper albums default to **checked**
- Already-saved albums are disabled

`handleImportAlbums()` — creates `Music Album` items from checked results.

### Add Modal Autosuggest
When category is `Music Album` and the author field has 2+ chars, a debounced (600ms) iTunes search runs and shows a dropdown of matching albums. Clicking a suggestion fills title, imageUrl, and url (only if those fields are currently empty).

Key functions: `handleAuthorItunesLookup()`, `showItunesSuggestions()`, `hideItunesSuggestions()`, `applyItunesSuggestion()` (all in `js/addEditModal.js`); `debounce()` is in `js/utils.js`.

---

## Sidebar Structure

`renderSidebar()` iterates `CATEGORIES.filter(cat => cat !== 'Music Album')` — Music Album is never a top-level sidebar entry.

For the `Musician` category, a **permanent hardcoded subfolder** is injected:
```js
<div class="sidebar-item sidebar-subfolder ..." data-view="Music Album" data-permanent="true">
  [Music Albums icon] Music Albums
</div>
```

In **regular mode**: clicking it sets `state.view = 'Music Album'`.

In **curated genre mode**: clicking it sets `state.view = 'genre:<genre>:Music Album'` — the `data-permanent="true"` attribute triggers this branch in the subfolder click handler.

## Curated Data (Firestore)

### Firestore project
- Project: `votecraft-789`
- Collection: `curated_items`
- API key (read-only, safe to expose): in `_FIREBASE_API_KEY` constant in `js/storage.js`

### Loading
`_loadCuratedFromFirestore()` (in `js/storage.js`) paginates the collection in 300-doc pages.
Loaded at startup via `initCuratedItems()`, which calls `setCuratedItems()` (in `js/state.js`) to populate the module-level `CURATED_ITEMS` binding — this indirection exists because ES modules can't let other files directly reassign an imported `let`, only the exporting module can, so `state.js` exposes a setter for it. `init()` (in `js/main.js`) calls `initCuratedItems()` on startup.
Cached in `chrome.storage.local` for 24 hours. Cache version: `_CURATED_CACHE_VERSION` in `js/storage.js` (bump to force refresh).

### Category normalization
Firestore stores plural/legacy category names. `_CAT_NORMALIZE` maps them to internal singular names:
```js
const _CAT_NORMALIZE = {
  'Movies': 'Movie', 'Books': 'Book', 'Games': 'Game',
  'Shows': 'Show', 'Musicians': 'Musician',
  'Music': 'Music Album', 'Music Albums': 'Music Album',
};
```
Applied in `_loadCuratedFromFirestore()` before building `CURATED_ITEMS`.

### CURATED_ITEMS structure
```js
CURATED_ITEMS = {
  'Top 100': {
    'Musician':    [ { id, title, url, imageUrl, notes, genre, category }, ... ],  // 100 artists
    'Music Album': [ { id, title, url, imageUrl, notes, genre, category }, ... ],  // 2444 albums
  },
  'Classic': { 'Movie': [...], 'Show': [...], 'Music Album': [...], ... },
  'Jazz':    { 'Movie': [...], 'Music Album': [...], ... },
  // ... other genres
}
```

### Musician / Music Album data
- **Artist entries** (`id: artist_itunes_<artistId>`): `category: 'Musician'`, title = artist name, `notes: null`
- **Album entries** (`id: itunes_<collectionId>`): `category: 'Music Album'`, title = album title, `notes` = artist name
- All Top 100 entries have `genre: 'Top 100'`
- Singles/EPs filtered out by title pattern at import time

### Populating curated data (admin scripts)
Scripts live in the Claude session scratchpad. To re-run, the Firestore `curated_items` rule must temporarily be `allow write: if true`. After running, revert to `allow write: if request.auth != null` and bump `_CURATED_CACHE_VERSION`.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Curated vs. Personal Items
- Curated items are read-only in the UI. IDs: `cur-*` (original), `itunes_*` (albums), `artist_itunes_*` (musicians).
- `state.hiddenCurated` — Set of curated IDs the user has dismissed.
- `state.curatedOverrides` — User edits to curated items stored separately.
- `ensureLiveItem()` — clones a curated item into `state.items` the first time a user queues or bookmarks it.
- When a `Music Album` is first saved via `ensureLiveItem()`, `autoSaveMusician()` is also called.

### `chrome.storage.onChanged`
Handles `item_`, `folder_`, and `author_` key prefixes. Guards against double-adding items.

### Bookmark / Save Logic
- Bookmark outline = not in personal list. Filled = saved.
- Tapping **Add to Queue** auto-saves (calls `ensureLiveItem()` then sets `queueStatus`).

## Known Open Issues

### Header Alignment Bug (unresolved)
The left edge of **"+ Add Item"** and **"ALL QUEUES"** are visually misaligned. Multiple CSS attempts haven't fixed it. Needs live DOM inspection via DevTools.

---

## Planned But Not Yet Built

### Spotify Integration
Phase 2 of iTunes integration. Will add Spotify OAuth for richer artist data (artist photos, full discography). iTunes path is already established — Spotify would augment it.

### Kanban Search & Tutorial Banner
- Add search/sort filtering inside `renderKanbanBoard()` (currently ignores `state.search`)
- Add a first-time tutorial banner, permanently dismissed via `savecraft_tutorial_seen`

## CSS Design Tokens

```css
--primary         /* purple accent */
--surface         /* card/modal background */
--border          /* border color */
--text-primary    /* main text */
--text-secondary  /* secondary text */
--text-muted      /* muted/icon text */
--hover-bg        /* hover state background */
```

## How to Reload After Changes

1. Edit any file in `Chrome Extensions/Savecraft/`
2. Go to `chrome://extensions`
3. Click the **↺ refresh** icon on the SaveCraft card
4. Reopen the library tab (or hard-refresh it)

No build step — changes are live after reload. `src/app/js/main.js` is loaded as an ES module (`<script type="module">`), so `import`/`export` typos surface as console errors on the library tab, not silent failures — always check DevTools console after a reload when editing `js/` or `css/` files.
